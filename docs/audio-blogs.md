We all love to read, but as developers, we are always busy! So, it's often difficult to find time to read - That's why we added the **Audio Blogs** feature on Hashnode blogs. ðŸ˜ƒ

This features automatically converts articles on a Hashnode blog into an audio version to enables developers to listen to their favorite articles while working on their day-to-day tasks (e.g., going for a run, cooking, etc.).

By doing this, developers can save more time every day and dedicate that to something else.

## How to get access to the Audio Blogs feature

The **Audio Blogs** feature is for only [Hashnode Ambassadors](https://hashnode.com/ambassador) because we want to first understand the usage and cost before rolling it out to everyone. This will also allow us to improve and optimize the offering before general availability.

If you need access to it now, consider becoming an [ambassador](https://hashnode.com/ambassador) by inviting a friend to use Hashnode. ðŸ˜ƒ
