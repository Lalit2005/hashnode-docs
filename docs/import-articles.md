## RSS Importer

In addition to our Medium, Dev.to, and Bulk markdown importer, you can also import articles to your Hashnode blog using our RSS importer.

The RSS importer is the most recommended method to use when migrating articles from WordPress to Hashnode. 😀

![Import from RSS](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1616158000163/BAjfQAck9.png?auto=compress)

To use the new RSS Importer, go to your blog's dashboard, navigate to Import and click on RSS Importer. In the _Import from RSS_ section, enter your RSS feed URL & the tag containing the post body into the input fields. Then, click on Import.
