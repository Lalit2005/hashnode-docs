<Callout type='warning'>
	The Team Blog feature is currently in beta (ongoing testing/improvements), and is not available publicly to all Hashnode users, and will become a paid feature soon.
</Callout>

However, if you think you need this feature to run an **active** team blog and you will be open to **give feedback**, please write to us at [support@hashnode.com](mailto:support@hashnode.com) to request to join the beta access list.

**Writing to us at [support@hashnode.com](mailto:support@hashnode.com) for getting into the beta access list doesnâ€™t fully guarantee access to the team publication. This feature will be available in GA by early 2022**

Remember, your _Team Blog_ is still a "blog"; all the features and settings of a _Personal Blog_ still apply. Hence, you can customize your _Team Blog_ as you deem fit using the guides provided [here](/docs/account-settings).

Before creating a team publication, here are some prerequisites needed:

- A Hashnode account. [Learn how to create one here](#create-an-account).
