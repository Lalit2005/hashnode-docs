You can automatically backup your published posts as markdown files to a public or private repository on GitHub. Backups are also updated automatically upon any edit or delete change.

Here is how to set up automatic GitHub backups on your blog:

1.  Create a [new repository](https://github.new/) on GitHub to store your articles, probably named **hashnode-backups** or **articles**.
2.  Log in to your Hashnode account.
3.  Click on your **profile picture** at the bottom-left corner of the page on _desktop_ screen or top-right corner on _mobile_ screen.
