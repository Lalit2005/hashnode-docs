Hashnode's analytics feature allows you to monitor your blog's performance via a visual representation alongside statistics for your articles.

You can also have a glimpse of your blog's performance right in Hashnode's Feed at the bottom-right corner of the page.

It displays the count of page views per day/week, the total number of posts you write in a week, and the number of likes or appreciations your posts received from the community.
